## ARCBOT 2030 - Christmas Gift for ARC 2024

60/70s SciFi inspired box with lights to do things

As you ponder why you picked this gift I just want to say, it is better than you think! Well, it could be for you or someone you know. The long story short, I have some other projects on my todo list and this was good practice to learn about making custom PCBs using Fusion and hopefully it will land in the hands of someone that is interested in electronics, 3d modelling, or just making things in general.

I have shared all the Fusion files (which has a free for personal use license) if you want to model your own enclosure or look at the electronics side. Just keep in mind... I have no idea what I am doing so it isn't going to be a "learn by example".

I also designed this project for others to easily pluck the components out and repurpose as they see fit. The only exception are the resistors that are soldered to the PCB. Other than that, you should be able to reuse all the sensors and components.

So, what does it actually do? Basically it is a simple temperature, humidity, and sit/stand timer. There is a "power" button that turns everything off. A "mode" button that toggles Temperature, Humidity, Sit-Stand Timer, and the 4th simply cycles through all three. The only other thing to note is to reset the sit/stand timer simply pick up and tilt the enclosure and it will reset the time.

If you are really interested you can read the code :) I used the Arduino IDE to write the code if interested.

Other than that, I hope you enjoy using, gutting, or regifted the one of a kind (actually, I made a couple) ARCBOT2030.
